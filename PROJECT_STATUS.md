# 📋 Project Status - SecureBank AI Assistant

## ✅ Phase 1: JWT Authentication (COMPLETE)

**🎯 What We Built:**
- **Secure FastAPI application** with enterprise security headers
- **JWT-based authentication** with role-based access control
- **Banking user roles**: Customer, Admin, Security with granular permissions
- **Comprehensive testing suite** with automated validation

**🔧 Technical Implementation:**
- **`app/main.py`**: FastAPI application with security middleware
- **`app/auth/models.py`**: Pydantic models for users, roles, and permissions
- **`app/auth/jwt_handler.py`**: JWT creation, validation, and user management
- **`test_phase1.sh`**: Automated testing script for all endpoints
- **`docs/phase1-authentication.md`**: Comprehensive documentation with process flows

**📋 Documentation Includes:**
- Step-by-step authentication process flow diagrams
- Security validation points and error handling
- Banking-specific role hierarchy and compliance alignment
- Visual representation of JWT validation process

**✅ Working Features:**
- User authentication with secure password hashing
- JWT token generation with role-based claims
- Protected endpoints with bearer token validation
- Role-based permission checking
- Security headers (XSS, CSRF, clickjacking protection)
- Proper error handling and validation

**📊 Test Results:**
```
✅ API health checks: PASSING
✅ Customer login: PASSING  
✅ JWT validation: PASSING
✅ Admin/Security roles: PASSING
✅ Invalid credentials rejection: PASSING (expected)
✅ Unauthorized access blocking: PASSING (expected)
```

**🎤 Interview Demo Points:**
1. **Show different user roles** and their permission matrices
2. **Explain JWT benefits** for banking AI systems (audit, stateless, scalable)
3. **Demonstrate security controls** preventing unauthorized access
4. **Discuss compliance alignment** (SOX, PCI-DSS requirements)

## ✅ Phase 2: AI Security Controls (COMPLETE)

**🎯 What We Built:**
- **Advanced Prompt Injection Detection Engine** with multi-pattern recognition
- **Comprehensive Content Filtering System** with PII redaction and role-based scoping
- **OWASP LLM Top 10 Compliance** implementation and testing framework
- **Security Monitoring Dashboard** with real-time threat metrics
- **Banking-specific Security Patterns** for financial threat detection

**🔧 Technical Implementation:**
- **`app/ai_security/prompt_injection.py`**: Advanced threat detection with 6 categories
- **`app/ai_security/content_filter.py`**: Multi-layer content filtering and PII protection
- **`app/models/schemas.py`**: Complete API models for AI security interactions
- **`test_phase2.sh`**: Comprehensive AI security testing script
- **`docs/phase2-ai-security.md`**: Detailed AI security implementation documentation

**✅ Working Features:**
- Real-time prompt injection detection and blocking
- PII detection and automatic redaction (SSN, credit cards, account numbers)
- Role-based AI response filtering (customer/admin/security)
- Banking-specific threat pattern recognition
- Security monitoring with threat level assessment
- OWASP LLM Top 10 compliance testing

**📊 Test Results:**
```
✅ 6/6 prompt injection attempts successfully blocked
✅ Content filtering working with PII redaction
✅ Role-based AI responses properly scoped
✅ Security dashboard accessible to authorized roles
✅ OWASP LLM compliance testing functional
```

## ✅ Phase 3: Threat Modeling & Documentation (COMPLETE)

**🎯 What We Built:**
- **Comprehensive Threat Model** using STRIDE methodology for banking AI systems
- **Security Assessment Report** with quantifiable metrics and compliance mapping
- **OWASP LLM Top 10** complete coverage analysis and implementation status
- **NIST AI RMF Alignment** documentation with governance, mapping, measurement, and management
- **Banking Compliance Documentation** (SOX, PCI-DSS, FFIEC regulatory alignment)
- **Interview Preparation Guide** with technical deep-dive talking points and demo scripts

**🔧 Technical Implementation:**
- **`docs/phase3-threat-model.md`**: Complete STRIDE analysis and risk assessment
- **`docs/security-assessment-report.md`**: Executive summary with security scoring (85/100)
- **`docs/interview-preparation-guide.md`**: Comprehensive interview strategy and Q&A

**📋 Documentation Includes:**
- STRIDE threat analysis with 18 specific threat scenarios
- OWASP LLM Top 10 complete implementation mapping
- NIST AI RMF four-pillar alignment (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage)
- Banking regulatory compliance assessment (SOX, PCI-DSS, FFIEC)
- Quantifiable security metrics and effectiveness measurements
- Production deployment recommendations and enhancement roadmap
- Complete interview preparation with technical talking points
